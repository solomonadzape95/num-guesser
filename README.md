# Number Guesser Application

## Overview

The Number Guesser application is a simple game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low, and allows the player a set number of guesses. If the player does not guess the correct number within the given attempts, the game ends. There is also an option to restart the game at any time.

## Features

1. **Set Number of Guesses**: The player has a limited number of guesses to find the correct number.
2. **Input System**: Players can input their guesses through an input field.
3. **Feedback System**: After each guess, the player receives feedback indicating if the guessed number is too low or too high.
4. **Restart Button**: A button that allows the player to restart the game at any point.

## How to Play

1. **Starting the Game**: When the game starts, a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100) is generated by the application.
2. **Making a Guess**: Enter your guess in the input field and submit it.
3. **Receiving Feedback**: After submitting your guess, the application will inform you if your guess is too low, too high, or correct.
4. **Winning the Game**: If you guess the correct number within the allowed number of guesses, you win the game.
5. **Losing the Game**: If you exhaust all your guesses without finding the correct number, you lose the game. You will be informed of the correct number.
6. **Restarting the Game**: You can click the restart button at any time to reset the game and generate a new random number.

## Example

1. **Start the Game**: The game generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. **Make a Guess**: The player enters '50' and submits.
3. **Receive Feedback**: The game responds, "Your guess is too low."
4. **Continue Guessing**: The player continues to guess until they either guess correctly or run out of guesses.
5. **Restart the Game**: If the player wishes to start over, they click the restart button, and a new random number is generated.
